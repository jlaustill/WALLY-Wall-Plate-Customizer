This version fixes a few bugs and adds support for new cutout types.

- Added "Keystone Jack - Dual" to allow a pair of keystone jacks side-by-side
- Fixed a bug where the first plate spot did not build unless one of the "full plate" options are used
- Fixed a bug involving a typo in the font's bold attribute ("Liberation Mono:Bol" -> "Liberation Mono:Bold")
- Improved layout of code
- Added Neutrik Cutouts (https://www.datapro.net/drawings/cutouts/neutrik_cutout.pdf) per HacksolotFilms's suggestion
